                A couple of weeks ago, I had the pleasure of having Leidy Perez give a guest lecture about AI in the industry...
            </p>
            <p>
                to my Data Communication Class on how AI is used in the industry.  Aside from giving 
                amazing career advice in general, she also mentioned this tool called KIRO that could "Create Requirements, 
                start coding based off those requirements, and then create and run test cases all in one environment".  This 
                sounded amazing so as soon as I could, I signed up for the waitlist.  Finally, today I decided to test out this
                new technology by creating a personal website!
            </p>

            <h2>1. Why a personal website, and why use AI?</h2>
            
            <p>
                In our current day and age with our current relationship to technology, I feel as is it is human nature to want
                a personal website.  There is an entire multi-mullion dollar industry populated by companies like Square Space
                (At least I'm guessing that's how much they make) for allowing people to host their own website.  As someone who
                has been fascinated with the web and how it works, I feel as if I am honestly a little overdue for a website.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that being said I just finished an entire Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, an education that should
                completely prepare me with the skills to create this whole website on my own, so why am I using AI?  The truth is 
                I think learning tools like KIRO will help me a lot more in the future, as while I do not see myself going into Web 
                Development, I think practicing using tools like this will help me configure and work with similar tools tailored to 
                Network Automation and management.  Plus, after completing so many school projects where I chose to do all of the hard 
                parts myself, it is kinda nice just typing a sentence and watching my work complete itself for me.
            </p>

            <h2>2. First Steps building the website</h2>
            <p>
                My first impression with KIRO were a bit of a mixed bag.  This tool truly is amazing as it created a full project 
                directory for me including an index.html homepage, a great start to a javascript file, and a 700-line css style sheet 
                for me in minutes.  It responded very well to styling feedback such as changing the website color, but then I hit my
                first roadblock.  I specifically prompted KIRO to make one sample blog page and update the website source code to
                link to this page, and KIRO instead decided to try and create 3 sample blog pages, got stuck 5 lines into the third page
                and never updated the back-end to link to the new pages.  This was the start of a bigger problem that I was begining to notice
                KIRO will get overwhelmed and seem to give up during tasks, then return as if it finished its job perfectly.
